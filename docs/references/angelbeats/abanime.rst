    | She collapses at work. She awoke in the hospital unable to speak.

* Otonashi thinks to himself that just following what Kanade says isn't that simple to leave the world.

.. [#ep3_gdm] The start time on the poster says the concert starts at 7pm.
.. [#ep3_hmv] Think of a HMV type store.

    | *As student council president, it was her duty to stop us.*
    | *Since the SSS created weapons, she created guard skills to counter them.*
    | *Is this how it ends? it's so rediclious, we don't have any clues about God yet.* [#ep5_wereassholes]_
* Otonashi asks about Kanade joining the SSS. Summerised:
    | *"Maybe Angel will be willing to join up with the battlefront now"*
    | *"I could see [Kanade] coming by herself, to buy a meal ticket and sit in the corner of the cafeteria all alone."*
    | *"She's lost all trust and even her position. That image of her looked painfully lonesome."*
* Naoi's posse storm and surround the SSS. Naoi tells the posse to take the SSS to detention.

.. [#ep5_wording] How this is said in the dub is better.
.. [#ep5_name] Yuri knew Kanade's name but "forgot", but feels like they are lying.
.. [#ep5_naoi] They think Naoi is a normal student at this point.
.. [#ep5_tofu] She comes to this conclusion because of Kanade getting the mapo tofu.
.. [#ep5_wereassholes] "Are we the baddies?"

* Otonashi is woken by an explosion. A drip from the roof of the cell lands on the bed.
* Yuri comes on via the walkie-talkie, with explosions still occouring. Summerised:
    | *Naoi is not an NPC, they are a human just like them. He's cruel and bullying other students.*

    | *The SSS are going into battle, unlike anything they have ever faced.*
    | *Naoi is using the normal students as shields and hostages because the SSS can't fight back.*

* Otonashi wakes Kanade up and asks her for help. [#ep6_help]_
* Kanade attacks the door with Hand Sonic, but the door has a force field applied to it. She notes that she didn't make it to be an offensive weapon.

* Kanade and Otonashi break out, and run to the track field. They see the SSS gunned down on the field.
* Naoi asks how they escaped. Kanade replies that she broke down the door. Naoi responds with "do you realise how many years that took to make?".
* Naoi orders Kanade to go back to her cell. Otonashi asks Kanade if what Naoi is doing is right.
* Naoi then claims that he is God.
* Naoi claims that everyone in the world has memories of being alive and lived terrible lives, and thinks that being in the world means they have the right to be God.
* Naoi walks over to Yuri and picks her up by her hair.
* Naoi claims he's going to put Yuri to rest. He mentions that Iwasawa lost her voice and dream of singing.

    | Yuri tries to hold back from Naoi.
* Otonashi knocks Naoi over, breaking the connection with Yuri.
* Otonashi says:
    | The lives all of us lived were real and everyone lived their fullest.
    | The memories of their struggles to live.
    | You can't just put a new coat of paint over them.
* Naoi starts remembering his own memories of when he was alive:
    | His brother died after falling from a tree and landing on a rock.
    | They were brothers in a family of famous ceramics artisans.
    | Naoi's brother was a prodigy and made a sucessor while they were young. Naoi played in his room without any attention from his parents.
    | He feels like he was the one who died and was replaced by his brother.
    | He was seperated under the guise of rehabilitating, but went under severe pottery training to match the skill level.
    | His father used to yell at him every day because they were not good enough.
    | He trained hard and won an award, but felt like his brother could have done a lot better.
    | His father was disappointed in him though, not meeting the expecation or skill of his brother.
    | Naoi was looking forward to continue training, but his father turned ill without any recovery.
    | Naoi's father was no longer able to train him further.
    | Naoi felt like his life had no purpose, as he couldn't run the studio at his skill level and couldn't make it on his own.
    | Naoi felt like his purpose was just to take care of his father from then on.
* Otonashi continues:
    | You (Naoi) was the one who worked hard and struggled.
    | Naoi asks how Otonashi knows, and Otonashi says it's because he's there right now.
    | Otonashi says he acknowledges Naoi's existance because he's there right now.
    | Naoi says (in the flashback) that he wanted his father to acknowledge him. 

.. [#ep6_detention] The SSS come out of "1st introspection room", and images from the VN suggests there are 3 rooms here. [#ep6_detretcon]_
.. [#ep6_detretcon] Because this is very minor detail, I feel it's safe retconning the sign above the door or the number of supposed doors here.
.. [#ep6_sleep] Kanade goes to sleep as soon as she's locked up with Otonashi. This seems a bit weird, but this line could be several hours after they entered the cell.
.. [#ep6_help] Could be a flashback to her remembering Chiyo saying about not turning away from someone asking for help.
.. [#ep6_nofriends] This would be because she doesn't remember any of her previous friends.

.. [#ep7_illness] Hatsune's illness isn't disclosed anywhere officially. [#ep7_illnessidea]_
.. [#ep7_illnessidea] An idea for Hatsune's illness could be CVID. This is the same one as Ironmouse and allows for a character like her being introduced, seeing as Hatsune exists. The only problem is that CVID has no cure, which Chiyo might have trouble fixing.
.. [#ep7_trees] Hatsune's wish could be to see christmas trees all decorated for Christmas.
.. [#ep7_fish] A "plot hole" is the surprisingly deep water for a fish of that size to be there. However, there isn't anything to suggest that this is near the bridges so this could be some distance away from them.

.. [#ep8_wrongplace] Also from the wrong position from where she should be.
.. [#ep8_attack] The direction of the spiral attack is clockwise, from Kanade's point of view. But the stab comes from counter-clockwise, so it doesn't have the momentum there.
.. [#ep8_infirmary] **Idea plothole** - Kanade is in the infirmary in her pyjamas, but was attacked in her school uniform. A reveal later on is meant to show that Kanade is covered in injuries. How did her clothes get changed without anyone noticing?

Episode 2
-----------

* The school name is shown on a destroyed sign and is "<something> academy", with ``学園`` being the only words visible. Based on the size of the characters and the remaining space on the sign, it's estimated to be around 5 characters; assuming no spaces. Zack says the first two characters will be either ``私立`` (private) or ``国立`` (public) as almost all schools begin with one of these.
* The main secret access to (new) guild is via a hatch, under the chair storage in the gym.
* There is a shallow river on the way to the guild.
* Yuri mentions she was the first one to fight back against Kanade.
* Yuri says "nothing with a soul can be given life, but objects can be formed as long as you know the composition and structure" (using the dirt/mud method).
* Someone in the guild has knowledge of the `German anti-tank grenades <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stielhandgranate>`__, used in WW1 and WW2. [#ww2]_

Episode 4
-----------

* The school holds a seemingly regular baseball tournament between classes/groups.

Episode 5
-----------
* Naoi mentions about a curfew being in place.

Episode 6
-----------
* Naoi says one of the rules is that it's forbidden to eat during breaks. Kanade acknowledges this, saying she forgot. This could be more "breaks" and "lunch" are different. Addationally, it might be more of a "can't just get up and leave class to go eat".
* Hand sonic flickers after trying to attack the cell door.

.. [#amnesia] Supporting: Supports the idea that people don't remember their past straight away.

.. [#nocomment] Supporting/Contradiction: Kanade was going to be shown as knowing how the world works, but having her memory erased so she forgot. Her going 'no comment' can support that she does know (and refusing to tell) while also contradicting that she doesn't know, or still remembers.
