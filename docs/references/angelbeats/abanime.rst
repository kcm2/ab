    | She collapses at work. She awoke in the hospital unable to speak.

Based on the size of the characters and the remaining space on the sign, it's estimated to be around 5 characters; assuming no spaces.

Episode 6
-----------
* Naoi says one of the rules is that it's forbidden to eat during breaks. Kanade acknowledges this, saying she forgot. This could be more "breaks" and "lunch" are different. Addationally, it might be more of a "can't just get up and leave class to go eat".
* Hand sonic flickers after trying to attack the cell door.

Footnotes
=====================

.. [#injury-belly] Contradiction: Later on, it was going to be shown that Kanade has a scar to one side of her body, rather than being in the middle.

.. [#bulletwound] Contradiction: Later on, Kanade was shown to have injuries and scars. This shows a bullet being removed with no left over injury.

.. [#amnesia] Supporting: Supports the idea that people don't remember their past straight away.

.. [#nocomment] Supporting/Contradiction: Kanade was going to be shown as knowing how the world works, but having her memory erased so she forgot. Her going 'no comment' can support that she does know (and refusing to tell) while also contradicting that she doesn't know, or still remembers.

.. [#ww2] Supporting: Supports the idea that Chaa (or at least some other member of the SSS) was in WW2.

.. [#yuriturn] This could be the turning point of Yuri. 

evil kanade is the younger kanade that was forced to fight when being expermented on
