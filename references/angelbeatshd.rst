Volume 1
==========

Chapter 1
-----------

* The first few pages start off within the anime timeline (where Otonashi exists), where Hinata shows up to a strategy meeting in his NPC uniform as he slept in. Him and Otonashi run back to the dorms to get changed, and the flashback starts.
* Hinata was killed by being hit by a lorry [#v1c1-1]_.
* He wakes up on the right hand side of the classroom buildings, other students not really caring that he's suddenly appeared.
* He is approched by Kanade who informs him that class is about to start.
* He and Kanade run to the classroom, going past Yuri who notices, and is still in the normal uniform.
* The other students and the teacher already know his name [#v1c1-2]_.
* In a panic, he runs to the roof and looks out over the school [#v1c1-3]_ when Yuri kicks him off the roof.
* He wakes up in the infirmary, him and Yuri talk briefly.
* They go to the roof (assumingly, of the infirmary).
* Yuri says the rest of the student and teachers are NPCs.

.. [#v1c1-1] An articulated lorry. Like the UK ones, based on the image from the manga.
.. [#v1c1-2] Will require explaining how this is possible.
.. [#v1c1-3] The image in the manga here is not correct for where his actual position would be, based on the anime.
