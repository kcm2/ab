Volume 1
==========

Chapter 1
-----------

* The first few pages start off within the anime timeline (where Otonashi exists), where Hinata shows up to a strategy meeting in his NPC uniform as he slept in. Him and Otonashi run back to the dorms to get changed, and the flashback starts.
* Hinata was killed by being hit by a lorry [#v1c1-1]_.
* He wakes up on the right hand side of the classroom buildings, other students not really caring that he's suddenly appeared.
* He is approched by Kanade who informs him that class is about to start.
* He and Kanade run to the classroom, going past Yuri who notices, and is still in the normal uniform.
* The other students and the teacher already know his name [#v1c1-2]_.
* In a panic, he runs to the roof and looks out over the school [#v1c1-3]_ when Yuri kicks him off the roof.
* He wakes up in the infirmary, him and Yuri talk briefly.
* They go to the roof (assumingly, of the infirmary).
* Yuri says the rest of the student and teachers are NPCs.
* Yuri says while she hasn't met God, she believes that they are the one that created the world. She also thinks that somewhere someone with similar powers is pulling the strings behind the world. She also thinks that NPCs are decorations to seem like they are spending their school life with you. [#wis-1]_
* Hinata's mum is called Yuri.
* Yuri talks about her plan to find, meet and punch God.

.. [#v1c1-1] An articulated lorry. Like the UK ones, based on the image from the manga.
.. [#v1c1-2] Will require explaining how this is possible.
.. [#v1c1-3] The image in the manga here is not correct for where his actual position would be, based on the anime.

Chapter 2
-----------

* Yuri talks about killing one of the students to make God come out of hiding.
* Hinata calls out that murdering the students would mean they are homicidal maniacs. This hits a note with Yuri seeing as what happened in her past.
* They argue on the roof of the infirmary about ideas they could pull off.
* Kanade comes up to them and tells it's time for class.
* Yuri goes "no u" and Kanade replies she's been given permission from the teachers.
* Yuri thinks Kanade controls the NPCs and "she's as close to god as it gets" [#v1c2-1]_ [#wis-2]_.
* Hinata asks if Kanade thinks God exists, she replies that she doesn't know, and can't imigine if he did exist [#wis-3]_. Hinata already thinks she is feigning ignorance.
* He asks if there is there is anyone she likes/loves. She replies no.
* Hinata asks what she would do if he were to confess, she replies she doesn't know. As he is about to ask Kanade to go out with him, Yuri kicks him off the roof. He wakes up in the infirmary.
* Yuri talks about how love might not be a feeling in the afterlife world, and "there is no way we could fall in love". Yuri looks out the window, defeated, at this.
* Hinata thinks that this is a good idea, and allows people to heal wounds. Hinata noticed that Yuri deflects happiness and always seems to be rushing around.
* Yuri goes to kiss Hinata but pulls away as the joke.
* Hinata asks if he can still get hungry even though they are dead. Yuri confirms this, and they they can sleepy too.
* Yuri is unsure if they also have sexual urges too. 
* Hinata and Yuri go to the cafeteria.
* Yuri says that the world is a place for people to sort their hearts out, and once they have no more regrets, they will disappear [#v1c2-2]_.
* Yuri mentions they can get money from scholarships, which have been prepared in the office, which they will go to tomorrow.
* Yuri says the dorms are 2-person rooms. She has already driven her roommate out [#v1c2-3]_.
* Hinata's roommate is Ooyama. They have a brief conversation and Hinata comments that he has no personality.
* The next day, Hinata meets Yuri on the classroom roof. 
* A gunshot is heard. Yuri seems shocked that a gun exists in the world. They run to go find the source.

.. [#v1c2-1] This is before we've been shown any of her powers, meaning Yuri had to have came to this conclusion before the start of the manga [#wis-2]_.
.. [#v1c2-2] This seems to conflict with her behaviour in the anime.
.. [#v1c2-3] This will need explaining what happens when the roommate is kicked out.

Chapter 3
-----------

* A PA announcement is made for students to stay in their classrooms. Yuri and Hinata arrive at the principal's office. 4 teachers are trying to get into the room with Kanade standing behind them.
* Kanade excuses her way past the teaches and goes into the principal's office.
* <Guy> is holding the principal hostage, with a gun to their head. Kanade activates Hand Sonic and attacks <Guy>.
* The teachers stop Hinata and Yuri. They say "<Kanade> just went in". The teacher was about to reply but gunshots are heard.
* They burst into the room. Kanade has blood on her [#v1c3-1]_ and sees her standing in front of the incapacitated <Guy>.
* Kanade moves, staggers, having been shot several times. Kanade leaves [#v1c3-2]_. Yuri is shocked/surprised. Hinata and Yuri go to the cafeteria.
* They talk about Kanade and her powers. Yuri thinks that Kanade is god.
* Ooyama spots Yuri and Hinata in the cafeteria, and joins them. Yuri leaves.
* Ooyama and Hinata talk in their dorm room at night. Hinata asks Ooyama if he thinks Kanade is the same as them. He replies that he does.

.. [#v1c3-1] She also has blood coming from her mouth. It's not clear if this is her blood, or <Guys>.
.. [#v1c3-2] It is not clear where she goes.

Chapter 4
-----------

* They are about to take the principal hostage - Hinata has a bat and Yuri managed to sneak the gun out of the staff room, though it has no bullets left.
* Yuri demands for God to come out, the principal doesn't know anything about it. He calls her insane.
* The principal comments "why do I always have to keep dealing with this" and he further explains that he doesn't rememebr how many times it's been, and others have pulled the same stunt.
* Kanade comes into the principal's office. She goes to stab Hinata first but Yuri pulls her attention away.
* Hinata tries to attack Kanade from behind, but Hand Sonic slices through the metal bat.
* Hinata grabs Kanade's hand, and she throws him back against the wall. He grabs her ankle. She says that she doesn't want to hurt him.
* Kanade mentions that "everyone who feels that they were treated unreasonably target the principal" and how he doesn't know anything. She says "that mistake continues to occur, which is why she corrects them".
* Yuri releases the principal. Kanade asks Yuri to hand over the gun. Yuri asks Kanade to withdraw Hand Sonic, she does so. Yuri then holds the gun to Kanade's head. Yuri demands Kanade answers. Kanade reactivates Hand Sonic, but Hinata gets in the way before she can stab Yuri.
* Hinata "dies" in Yuri's arms on the floor. He wakes up in the infirmary. Yuri mentions Kanade destroyed the gun [#v1c4-1]_.
* Hinata and Yuri go to the cafeteria. Hinata has Nattou and curry. Yuri thinks that Kanade is on the same level as God, or 2nd in command, and thinks that the power was given to her.
* Yuri then says that if Kanade is the one that maintains order, they have to destroy that order and that will force god to appear.
* Hinata then goes back to his room. He gives Ooyama the Nattou. He makes an off-hand remark about the world being in a game, this confuses Ooyama and he replies "but I wonder how you get out of this world" and Hinata is shocked.
* Ooyama revealed that he thought Hinata already knew.

-----------

* Hinata takes Ooyama to meet Yuri, which is on the roof of the classrooms.
* Yuri kicks Hinata off the roof, again, and wakes up in the infirmary.
* During the discussion, Hinata says things that hit a nerve with Yuri. "You're not as capable as you think you are. That's right, if you were by yourself you wouldn't accomplish anything."
* Yuri, angry at this, wants to seperate saying "I don't need partners, that's right, I'll be fine by myself. It's always been like that". She leaves the infirmary.
* Hinata meets Ooyama outside of the classrooms.
* Yuri is seen going up the classroom stairs.
* During a discussion between Hinata and Ooyama, he says "Hinata, you seem like a game protaganist. You solve everyone's problems and save them. It would have been great...If I... had a friend like that." Ooyama picks up on that Yuri must be deeply troubled.
* To himself, Hinata thinks "to be on your own in this world...is really lonely".
* Hinata also says "I've already decided..to bever leave her[Yuri] alone...to never let her feel lonely".

* A teacher shows up and pulls Yuri off Kanade. Yuri continues to spout deranged comments such as "she's not human", "she's an angel with special powers". The teacher comments that he'll listen in the guidance councillers office. The teacher continues to drag her away.
* Hinata punches the teacher, after come conversation, he hugs Yuri, who punshes him. Hinata wipes a tear from Yuri's eye, she goes to hit him again but Kanade grabs her hand. Kanade apologies to Hinata saying he has became her scapegoat. She uses a tissue/hankie to wipe his cheeks.

Chapter 7

Working ideas
================

.. [#wis-1] To still account for the "weird" behaviour with the NPCs that Yuri talks about, this could be that Yuri might have already been shunned because of frequent outbursts over the them being npcs by the time Hinata has shown up. At this moment, it doesn't look like Yuri is friends with anyone either.
.. [#wis-2] This means in my idea, I would need to show this, and extend this arch before HD. Unless this is covered later on in the manga, if Yuri goes over how/when she appeared.
.. [#wis-3] This supports my idea that Kanade erased her own memory can't can't remember anything about Chiyo.
.. [#wis-4] This supports that the SSS are the "social outcasts" and why no other students really interact with them. This scene has basiclly shown Yuri to be deranged, thinking that Kanade "isn't human" and "an angel sent from God".
