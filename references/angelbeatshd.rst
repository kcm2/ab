Volume 1
==========

Chapter 1
-----------

* The first few pages start off within the anime timeline (where Otonashi exists), where Hinata shows up to a strategy meeting in his NPC uniform as he slept in. Him and Otonashi run back to the dorms to get changed, and the flashback starts.
* Hinata was killed by being hit by a lorry [#v1c1-1]_.
* He wakes up on the right hand side of the classroom buildings, other students not really caring that he's suddenly appeared.
* He is approched by Kanade who informs him that class is about to start.
* He and Kanade run to the classroom, going past Yuri who notices, and is still in the normal uniform.
* The other students and the teacher already know his name [#v1c1-2]_.
* In a panic, he runs to the roof and looks out over the school [#v1c1-3]_ when Yuri kicks him off the roof.
* He wakes up in the infirmary, him and Yuri talk briefly.
* They go to the roof (assumingly, of the infirmary).
* Yuri says the rest of the student and teachers are NPCs.
* Yuri says while she hasn't met God, she believes that they are the one that created the world. She also thinks that somewhere someone with similar powers is pulling the strings behind the world. She also thinks that NPCs are decorations to seem like they are spending their school life with you. [#wis-1]_
* Hinata's mum is called Yuri.
* Yuri talks about her plan to find, meet and punch God.

.. [#v1c1-1] An articulated lorry. Like the UK ones, based on the image from the manga.
.. [#v1c1-2] Will require explaining how this is possible.
.. [#v1c1-3] The image in the manga here is not correct for where his actual position would be, based on the anime.

Chapter 2
-----------

* Yuri talks about killing one of the students to make God come out of hiding.
* Hinata calls out that murdering the students would mean they are homicidal maniacs. This hits a note with Yuri seeing as what happened in her past.
* They argue on the roof of the infirmary about ideas they could pull off.
* Kanade comes up to them and tells it's time for class.
* Yuri goes "no u" and Kanade replies she's been given permission from the teachers.
* Yuri thinks Kanade controls the NPCs and "she's as close to god as it gets" [#v1c2-1]_ [#wis-2]_.
* Hinata asks if Kanade thinks God exists, she replies that she doesn't know, and can't imigine if he did exist [#wis-3]_. Hinata already thinks she is feigning ignorance.
* He asks if there is there is anyone she likes/loves. She replies no.
* Hinata asks what she would do if he were to confess, she replies she doesn't know. As he is about to ask Kanade to go out with him, Yuri kicks him off the roof. He wakes up in the infirmary.
* Yuri talks about how love might not be a feeling in the afterlife world, and "there is no way we could fall in love". Yuri looks out the window, defeated, at this.
* Hinata thinks that this is a good idea, and allows people to heal wounds. Hinata noticed that Yuri deflects happiness and always seems to be rushing around.
* Yuri goes to kiss Hinata but pulls away as the joke.
* Hinata asks if he can still get hungry even though they are dead. Yuri confirms this, and they they can sleepy too.
* Yuri is unsure if they also have sexual urges too. 
* Hinata and Yuri go to the cafeteria.
* Yuri says that the world is a place for people to sort their hearts out, and once they have no more regrets, they will disappear [#v1c2-2]_.
* Yuri mentions they can get money from scholarships, which have been prepared in the office, which they will go to tomorrow.
* Yuri says the dorms are 2-person rooms. She has already driven her roommate out [#v1c2-3]_.
* Hinata's roommate is Ooyama. They have a brief conversation and Hinata comments that he has no personality.
* The next day, Hinata meets Yuri on the classroom roof. 
* A gunshot is heard. Yuri seems shocked that a gun exists in the world. They run to go find the source.

.. [#v1c2-1] This is before we've been shown any of her powers, meaning Yuri had to have came to this conclusion before the start of the manga [#wis-2]_.
.. [#v1c2-2] This seems to conflict with her behaviour in the anime.
.. [#v1c2-3] This will need explaining what happens when the roommate is kicked out.

Chapter 3
-----------

* A PA announcement is made for students to stay in their classrooms. Yuri and Hinata arrive at the principal's office. 4 teachers are trying to get into the room with Kanade standing behind them.
* Kanade excuses her way past the teaches and goes into the principal's office.
* <Guy> is holding the principal hostage, with a gun to their head. Kanade activates Hand Sonic and attacks <Guy>.
* The teachers stop Hinata and Yuri. They say "<Kanade> just went in". The teacher was about to reply but gunshots are heard.
* They burst into the room. Kanade has blood on her [#v1c3-1]_ and sees her standing in front of the incapacitated <Guy>.
* Kanade moves, staggers, having been shot several times. Kanade leaves [#v1c3-2]_. Yuri is shocked/surprised. Hinata and Yuri go to the cafeteria.
* They talk about Kanade and her powers. Yuri thinks that Kanade is god.
* Ooyama spots Yuri and Hinata in the cafeteria, and joins them. Yuri leaves.
* Ooyama and Hinata talk in their dorm room at night. Hinata asks Ooyama if he thinks Kanade is the same as them. He replies that he does.

.. [#v1c3-1] She also has blood coming from her mouth. It's not clear if this is her blood, or <Guys>.
.. [#v1c3-2] It is not clear where she goes.

Chapter 4

Working ideas
================

.. [#wis-1] To still account for the "weird" behaviour with the NPCs that Yuri talks about, this could be that Yuri might have already been shunned because of frequent outbursts over the them being npcs by the time Hinata has shown up. At this moment, it doesn't look like Yuri is friends with anyone either.
.. [#wis-2] This means my I would need to show this, and extend this arch before HD. Unless this is covered later on in the manga, if Yuri goes over how/when she appeared.
.. [#wis-3] This supports my idea that Kanade erased her own memory can't can't remember anything about Chiyo.
