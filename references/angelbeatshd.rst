Volume 1
==========

Chapter 1
-----------

* The first few pages start off within the anime timeline (where Otonashi exists), where Hinata shows up to a strategy meeting in his NPC uniform as he slept in. Him and Otonashi run back to the dorms to get changed, and the flashback starts.
* Hinata was killed by being hit by a lorry [#v1c1-1]_.
* He wakes up on the right hand side of the classroom buildings, other students not really caring that he's suddenly appeared.
* He is approched by Kanade who informs him that class is about to start.
* He and Kanade run to the classroom, going past Yuri who notices, and is still in the normal uniform.
* The other students and the teacher already know his name [#v1c1-2]_.
* In a panic, he runs to the roof and looks out over the school [#v1c1-3]_ when Yuri kicks him off the roof.
* He wakes up in the infirmary, him and Yuri talk briefly.
* They go to the roof (assumingly, of the infirmary).
* Yuri says the rest of the student and teachers are NPCs.
* Yuri says while she hasn't met God, she believes that they are the one that created the world. She also thinks that somewhere someone with similar powers is pulling the strings behind the world. She also thinks that NPCs are decorations to seem like they are spending their school life with you. [#wis-1]_
* Hinata's mum is called Yuri.
* Yuri talks about her plan to find, meet and punch God.

.. [#v1c1-1] An articulated lorry. Like the UK ones, based on the image from the manga.
.. [#v1c1-2] Will require explaining how this is possible.
.. [#v1c1-3] The image in the manga here is not correct for where his actual position would be, based on the anime.

Chapter 2
-----------

* Yuri talks about killing one of the students to make God come out of hiding.
* Hinata calls out that murdering the students would mean they are homicidal maniacs. This hits a note with Yuri seeing as what happened in her past.
* They argue on the roof of the infirmary about ideas they could pull off.
* Kanade comes up to them and tells it's time for class.
* Yuri goes "no u" and Kanade replies she's been given permission from the teachers.
* Yuri thinks Kanade controls the NPCs and "she's as close to god as it gets" [#v1c2-1]_ [#wis-2]_.
* Hinata asks if Kanade thinks God exists, she replies that she doesn't know, and can't imigine if he did exist [#wis-3]_. Hinata already thinks she is feigning ignorance.
* He asks if there is there is anyone she likes/loves. She replies no.
* Hinata asks what she would do if he were to confess, she replies she doesn't know. As he is about to ask Kanade to go out with him, Yuri kicks him off the roof. He wakes up in the infirmary.
* Yuri talks about how love might not be a feeling in the afterlife world, and "there is no way we could fall in love". Yuri looks out the window, defeated, at this.
* Hinata thinks that this is a good idea, and allows people to heal wounds. Hinata noticed that Yuri deflects happiness and always seems to be rushing around.
* Yuri goes to kiss Hinata but pulls away as the joke.
* Hinata asks if he can still get hungry even though they are dead. Yuri confirms this, and they they can sleepy too.

* Yuri mentions they can get money from scholarships, which have been prepared in the office, which they will go to tomorrow.
* Yuri says the dorms are 2-person rooms. She has already driven her roommate out [#v1c2-3]_.
* Hinata's roommate is Ooyama. They have a brief conversation and Hinata comments that he has no personality.
* The next day, Hinata meets Yuri on the classroom roof. 
* A gunshot is heard. Yuri seems shocked that a gun exists in the world. They run to go find the source.

.. [#v1c2-1] This is before we've been shown any of her powers, meaning Yuri had to have came to this conclusion before the start of the manga [#wis-2]_.
.. [#v1c2-2] This seems to conflict with her behaviour in the anime.
.. [#v1c2-3] This will need explaining what happens when the roommate is kicked out.

Chapter 30
-----------

* Yuri is with the group where Noda 'died'. Yuri, Shiina, Hinata and Ooyama discuss. They think that Noda is the only one being targeted. They also think that is because Noda is the only one holding a weapon.
* They walk around the classrooms with weapons, and the students are staring at them. They notice Kanade coming down the stairs, and she notices them, commenting "you guys never learn".

* The attacker is confused as the person dies but the next day it's like nothing happened and she keeps killing them, again and again. The three talk it over and Yuri invites the attacker to join the SSS.
* The attacker declines
    | Yuri: For everything to become like this must be God's idea of a practial joke, since everything is God's will.
    | Attacker: Gods are just man's creation.
    | Yuri: Before coming into this world, I thought the same way as you do. Here, evidence of God exisiting can be found everywhere... [#wis-12]_ 
* The attacker doesn't agree with this, and still can't stand that men exist and just wants to kill them all.
* Yuri shrugs the attacker off "what a pain". Yuri suggests a female only team of the SSS but the attacker mentions they don't care. Yuri mentions the attacker would still attack men without being ordered and that she is too stubborn, and says "just do as you please". Yuri then leaves the room, leaving the attacker alone [#wis-13]_.

Working ideas
================

.. [#wis-1] To still account for the "weird" behaviour with the NPCs that Yuri talks about, this could be that Yuri might have already been shunned because of frequent outbursts over the them being npcs by the time Hinata has shown up. At this moment, it doesn't look like Yuri is friends with anyone either.
.. [#wis-2] This means in my idea, I would need to show this, and extend this arch before HD. Unless this is covered later on in the manga, if Yuri goes over how/when she appeared.
.. [#wis-3] This supports my idea that Kanade erased her own memory can't can't remember anything about Chiyo.
.. [#wis-4] This supports that the SSS are the "social outcasts" and why no other students really interact with them. This scene has basiclly shown Yuri to be deranged, thinking that Kanade "isn't human" and "an angel sent from God".
.. [#wis-5] They are wearing the school uniform for their gender.
.. [#wis-6] Important to use.
.. [#wis-7] They come from the south.
.. [#wis-8] She could have been abaonded by a partner and left to die or be caught.
.. [#wis-9] A bit of an important thing to remember.
.. [#wis-10] Supports the idea that there is still a passage of time, and dates this in Spring/near to summer.
.. [#wis-11] Supports the idea that when Yuri plays at the end, Kanade is surprised/shocked that Yuri can play. (Little Busters full)
.. [#wis-12] In this discussion, Yuri says she feels that something is spying on them. This supports the idea of Chiyo having "left" but is still around watching over everything.
.. [#wis-13] Chiyo would be angry that Yuri isn't showing any empathy towards the attacker.
.. [#wis-14] Something here about Chiyo saying to Kanade to not ignore/turn down people asking for help.
.. [#wis-15] May change the design if I can find a better design.
.. [#wis-16] Kanade is shown in school swimsuit here (implied no shoes/socks but not visible) but will change this. In the first appearance, she is shown without a hoodie, but in the 2nd appearance, she is wearing a hoodie over her swimming costume.
