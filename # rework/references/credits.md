see: subtitles

For each language, all of the creidts should be translated into the broadcast location language.

these would be hard coded onto the video file (see: IDs), depending on where it is being shown. may need discussion to see how it would work.

For example

Lang|No|Yes
--|--|--
EN|プロデューサー: かんち萌え|Producer: KanchiMoe
ES|プロデューサー: かんち萌え|Productora: KanchiMoe
RU|プロデューサー: かんち萌え|режиссер: KanchiMoe
